This has 3 files（ `Database`,  `image classification  ` , `image matching` ）

* `Database` has two files, one is KIMIA which I mainly used in my research.
* `image matching` is different algorithms that are used to detect key points or some image processing methods.
* `image classification` is my undergraduate research that developed the biological tissue image discrimination model. For API, if you input a tissue image you will get the tissue name of this image, and also you can get some similar tissue image which maybe useful for doctor to find the similar treatments of some tissue disease. For the research originality, I promote a new method to express an image based on the bag of visual words (BoVW) method.
